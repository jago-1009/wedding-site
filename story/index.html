By chance, their fates would intertwine beginning at a most unexpected birthday occasion. Little did they know, that between the awkward introductions and lawn chairs, each of them would be talking to their soul mate.</p> <aside class="story-aside"><img class="image-askew" src="../assets/img/jacob-jena-photo.png"
                            alt="A photo of Jacob and Jena">

                            <p>As chance would have it, they would only encounter each other occasionally after their first meeting—not truly becoming friends until they would join two very important, and very nerdy, high school clubs. After being bitten by the theater bug in ninth grade, Jena started up the Ben Davis University Drama Club. Its regular members were few, and of them was none other than Jacob Leroy Garwood. Ecstatic that other classmates showed Interest, Jena supplied Jake and the other members with scripts and acting opportunities. By the end of things. Jake would be chosen for lead roles in projects and performed in front of the group. He even won a paper Oscar-shaped award for his formidable acting chops!</p></aside>
                            <p>Basement Dwellers was a club for Uno, TTRPGs, and everything in between. After laughter (and occasionally rage) filled rounds of board and card games of all kinds, Jena and Jake would take on the challenge of starting the club's first Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Nerdiness and laughter led to a rich friendship.</p>
                            <p>After thorough contemplation, Jena came to a wonderful realization: Jacob Leroy Garwood had captured her heart. On a fateful night and after a D&D session at Basement Dwellers, Jena finally had the courage and opportunity to ask Jake the question, "Will you go out with me?". And, as you might guess, he said no.</p> <p>I'm kidding. What he actually said was, "No, I'm sorry, but I don't want to risk our friendship". </p>
                            <p>Then he paused for a brief moment and said, "Well, maybe...". And that was that. It was time for him to be picked up and go home.</p>
                            <p>Are you on the edge of your seat? Jena certainly was.</p>
                            <p>That night, Jena asked him if he would come with her and her family to drive up and visit Sweetwater Sound in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and to her delight, he said yes. (Thanks Mom and Dad for encouraging her to ask him!) Before she knew it, she was packed up in a van with her crush, parents, and siblings. The day was filled with scream-filled rides down a swirly slide, games of pool, and a finale of McDonald's french fries. They dropped Jake off at his parents' and that was that… until it wasn&apos;t!</p>
                            <p>That night Jake would finally say yes. And so was the beginning of a relationship filled with love and laughter.</p>
